        <h2>PROGRAMING LAGUAGES</h2>
        <p>•Programming languages •

            _Programming languages are a set of rules that are used to write computer software. Programming languages are a key element in the world of modern technology, as they are a means of communication between the computer and the programmer.
            
            1. We mention the importance of programming languages in achieving technological innovation in the following points: • Translating concepts into codes, as programming languages allow programmers to transform concepts and ideas into a set of codes and rules that the computer can understand and implement. • Technological innovation where programmers use Berm languages to achieve technological innovation through the design and development of innovative software technologies and solutions. • Unification of instructions: The use of programming languages unifies instructions that the computer can understand, which helps to achieve effective communication between the programmer and the machine. _Programming languages are a key tool for programmers to turn ideas into digital reality.
            
            2. There are several types of programming languages, let's mention some of the main types: • High-level programming languages, • Python: An easy-to-learn language, used to develop artificial intelligence and web applications. •java: It is used in a wide field in the development of web applications and Android. It is known as integration. •Dynamic programming languages: •java script: Used for web application development and user interaction is a powerful Script language. •Ruby: Easy to read and write and is used in the development of web applications. •Low-level programming languages: •C: They are used in hardware programming, which is an efficient language in terms of resource consumption. •Assembly: A low-level language used to program central processors directly. These are just a few models, and there are many other programming languages.3: Uses of programming languages: The uses of programming languages vary in the world of technology. These languages are used in the development of a wide range of applications and projects, as they have a large role in achieving technological innovation. In development in java script and python software. Analysts rely on languages such as C++ for R analysis and data visualisation in the field of game development, languages such as python are important in creating high-end video games. Unity script in the development of C systems uses low-level languages such as operation and hardware programming. Overall, we can say that the uses of programming languages include almost every aspect of modern technology.</p>
